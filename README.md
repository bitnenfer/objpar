objpar
======

Single header Wavefront OBJ parser.
 
Currently it depends on stdlib's atoi and atof. You can provide your own implementation
by doing 

`#define objpar_atoi my_atoi`
`#define objpar_atof my_atof`

 For now it only supports:
 - Geometric Vertices.
 - Vertex Normals.
 - Texture Vertices
 - Faces
